**SubScanX: Automated Subdomain Scanner with HTML Reporting**

SubScanX is a powerful Python-based tool that automates the process of identifying responsive subdomains from a provided list. Whether you are a cybersecurity professional, a penetration tester, or a web developer, this tool serves as a valuable asset for reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment.

**Key Features:**

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** SubScanX offers two modes of operation - GUI (Graphical User Interface) and Command Line. Users of all skill levels can effortlessly interact with the tool based on their preferences.

2. **Efficient Scanning:** SubScanX utilizes Python's asynchronous processing capabilities to deliver fast and reliable subdomain scanning. The tool rapidly identifies responsive subdomains while minimizing false positives.
